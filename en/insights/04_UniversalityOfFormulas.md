# Universality of Formulas

## Core Thesis

**All relativistic formulas are universal with Vmax as a parameter. Experiments prove the formulas in I_EM, not the universality of c.**

---

## The Key Insight

### What experiments actually prove:

```
Experiments confirm:
  E² = p²Vmax² + m²Vmax⁴  ✓ (formula is correct)

Experiments do NOT confirm:
  Vmax = c for ALL spaces  ✗ (assumption, not proven)
```

### The substitution:

```
In any relativistic formula:
  Replace: c → Vmax_k

Where Vmax_k is the maximum speed in information space I_k
```

---

## Examples

### 1. Energy-Momentum Relation

**Standard:**

```
E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²
```

**Universal:**

```
E² = (p·Vmax)² + (m·Vmax²)²
```

**Interpretation:**

- In I_EM: Vmax = c → standard formula
- In I_X: Vmax > c → modified formula
- In I_0: Vmax → ∞ → E = p·∞ (massless limit)

### 2. Lorentz Factor

**Standard:**

```
γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²)
```

**Universal:**

```
γ_k = 1/√(1 - v²/Vmax_k²)
```

**Interpretation:**

- As v → Vmax_k: γ_k → ∞
- Time dilation and length contraction relative to Vmax_k
- Different spaces have different "light cones"

### 3. Time Dilation

**Standard:**

```
Δt' = γ Δt = Δt/√(1 - v²/c²)
```

**Universal:**

```
Δt'_k = γ_k Δt = Δt/√(1 - v²/Vmax_k²)
```

**Interpretation:**

- Time dilation depends on Vmax of the space
- In I_X with Vmax > c: less time dilation for same v
- In I_0 with Vmax → ∞: no time dilation

### 4. Relativistic Momentum

**Standard:**

```
p = γmv = mv/√(1 - v²/c²)
```

**Universal:**

```
p_k = γ_k mv = mv/√(1 - v²/Vmax_k²)
```

**Interpretation:**

- Momentum diverges as v → Vmax_k
- Different spaces have different momentum scales

### 5. Mass-Energy Equivalence

**Standard:**

```
E = mc²
```

**Universal:**

```
E_k = m·Vmax_k²
```

**Interpretation:**

- Rest energy depends on Vmax of the space
- In I_X with Vmax > c: higher rest energy
- Energy is space-dependent!

## What Experiments Actually Test

### Particle Accelerators (LHC, etc.)

**What they measure:**

```
E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²  ✓ Confirmed to high precision
```

**What they DON'T measure:**

```
Whether Vmax = c in ALL spaces  ✗ Not tested
```

**Why:**

- All detectors are EM-based
- We measure in I_EM where Vmax = c
- Formula works perfectly in I_EM
- But this doesn't prove c is universal!

### GPS Satellites

**What they measure:**

```
Time dilation: Δt' = Δt/√(1 - v²/c²)  ✓ Confirmed
```

**What they DON'T measure:**

```
Whether this formula applies in I_X  ✗ Not tested
```

**Why:**

- GPS uses EM signals (radio waves)
- We're measuring in I_EM
- Formula works in I_EM
- But I_X may have different Vmax!

### Cosmic Rays

**What they measure:**

```
Muon lifetime extension: τ' = γτ  ✓ Confirmed
```

**What they DON'T measure:**

```
Whether γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) is universal  ✗ Not tested
```

**Why:**

- Muon decay is EM process
- Detection is EM-based
- We see EM projection of the process
- True speed may be > c, but we measure ≤ c

## The Crucial Distinction

### Formulas vs. Constants

**Formulas are universal:**

```
E² = p²Vmax² + m²Vmax⁴  ✓ Always true
γ = 1/√(1 - v²/Vmax²)   ✓ Always true
```

**Constants are space-specific:**

```
Vmax = c     ✓ True in I_EM
Vmax = c     ✗ NOT necessarily true in I_X
```

### What's proven vs. What's assumed

**Proven by experiments:**

- Relativistic formulas work in I_EM
- c is the maximum speed in I_EM
- Energy-momentum relation holds

**Assumed (not proven):**

- c is the maximum speed in ALL spaces
- Vmax = c everywhere
- No I_X with Vmax > c exists

---

## Implications

### 1. Multiple "Light Cones"

Each space I_k has its own light cone with slope Vmax_k:

```
I_EM:  slope = c
I_X:   slope = Vmax_X > c
I_0:   slope = ∞ (no cone)
```

### 2. Space-Dependent Causality

Causality is defined by Vmax of the space:

```
In I_EM:  Δt² > Δx²/c²     (timelike)
In I_X:   Δt² > Δx²/Vmax_X² (timelike in I_X)
```

Events timelike-separated in I_X may be spacelike in I_EM!

### 3. Energy Scales

Rest energy depends on the space:

```
E_EM = mc²
E_X = m·Vmax_X² > mc²  (if Vmax_X > c)
```

Same particle has different rest energy in different spaces!

### 4. Measurement Projection

When measuring I_X process in I_EM:

```
E_real = m·Vmax_X²  (in I_X)
E_measured = mc²    (in I_EM)

Energy "lost" = E_real - E_measured
```

This appears as "missing energy" in detectors!

## Experimental Tests

### Test 1: Formula Universality

**Hypothesis:**

```
E² = p²Vmax² + m²Vmax⁴ works in all spaces
```

**Test:**

- Measure E and p in different regimes
- Check if formula holds with Vmax as free parameter
- Look for deviations from Vmax = c

**Status:** No deviations found yet (within I_EM)

### Test 2: Space-Dependent Constants

**Hypothesis:**

```
Vmax varies between spaces
```

**Test:**

- Look for processes where Vmax ≠ c
- Missing energy in collisions
- Anomalous time dilation
- Superluminal correlations

**Status:** Some hints (dark energy, cosmic rays)

### Test 3: Multi-Space Transitions

**Hypothesis:**

```
Energy can transition between I_EM and I_X
```

**Test:**

- Look for contact points
- Measure energy balance
- Search for I_X → I_EM transitions

**Status:** Indirect evidence (neutrinos, dark matter)

## Connection to Other Insights

### Measurement as Projection

Even if v_real > c in I_X:

```
v_measured = min(v_real, c)
```

Because measurement is in I_EM with Vmax = c.

### EM Confinement

All measurements use EM transitions:

```
Detector response ∝ E_EM = mc²
NOT E_X = m·Vmax_X²
```

We always measure the I_EM projection!

### Contact Points

Energy transitions between spaces:

```
E_X = m·Vmax_X² → [Contact Point] → E_EM = mc²
```

With efficiency η = (c/Vmax_X)² < 1 if Vmax_X > c.

## Key Conclusions

1. **Formulas are universal**, constants are not
2. **Experiments prove formulas in I_EM**, not universality of c
3. **Each space I_k has its own Vmax_k**
4. **Measurements are projections** onto I_EM
5. **Missing energy** may indicate I_X processes
