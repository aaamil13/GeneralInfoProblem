# Multiple Information Spaces

## Core Concept

The foundation of Information Speed Theory is the existence of **multiple information spaces**, each with its own characteristic maximum speed.

### Definition

An information space I_k is characterized by:

- **Vmax_k**: Maximum speed for information propagation
- **Metric**: ds²_k = -Vmax_k² dt² + dx² + dy² + dz²
- **Causal structure**: Events A and B are causally connected if Δt > Δx/Vmax_k
- **Carriers**: Physical entities that propagate information (photons, gravitons, etc.)

### Known and Hypothetical Spaces

```
I_EM:  Electromagnetic space
  - Vmax = c ≈ 3×10⁸ m/s
  - Carriers: photons, EM waves
  - Well-established experimentally

I_GW:  Gravitational wave space
  - Vmax = c (measured via EM)
  - Carriers: gravitational waves
  - Detected by LIGO (2015)

I_X:   Hypothetical faster-than-light spaces
  - Vmax > c
  - Carriers: unknown
  - Not yet detected

I_0:   Source/Origin space
  - Pre-spatial, pre-temporal
  - Quantum information, causal sets
  - Theoretical construct
```

### Hierarchy

```
I_0 (Source)
  ↓
  ├─→ I_EM (Vmax = c)
  ├─→ I_GW (Vmax = c?)
  ├─→ I_X (Vmax > c)
  └─→ ... (other spaces)
```

## Properties

### 1. Each Space Has Its Own Metric

For information space I_k:

```
ds²_k = -Vmax_k² dt² + dx² + dy² + dz²
```

This metric is invariant under Lorentz transformations with Vmax_k as the limiting speed.

### 2. Causal Structure

Events A and B in space I_k are causally connected if:

```
Δt > Δx/Vmax_k
```

Different spaces have different causal structures!

### 3. Interactions Between Spaces

Spaces can interact through:

- **Projection**: Information from I_X projected onto I_EM
- **Phase transitions**: Transition between spaces at energy threshold
- **Mixing**: Quantum superposition of states in different spaces

## Implications

### For Physics

1. **Relativity is space-specific**: Each I_k has its own relativistic framework
2. **c is not universal**: c is the limit for I_EM, not for all spaces
3. **Multiple realities**: Different spaces may coexist

### For Epistemology

1. **Measurement limitation**: We can only measure what projects onto I_EM
2. **Unknowable reality**: Parts of reality may be fundamentally inaccessible
3. **Observer-dependent**: What we observe depends on which space we inhabit

## Experimental Evidence

### Indirect Indications

1. **Cosmic inflation**: Expansion faster than c suggests different vacuum state (I_X?)
2. **CMB correlations**: Correlations beyond light horizon
3. **Dark matter/energy**: May exist in different information space

### Future Tests

1. **High-energy physics**: Look for energy anomalies at E > 10 TeV
2. **Cosmology**: Analyze CMB for super-horizon correlations
3. **Multi-messenger astronomy**: Search for precursor signals

## Mathematical Formalism

### Generalized Lorentz Transformation

For space I_k:

```
x'_k = γ_k(x - vt)
t'_k = γ_k(t - vx/Vmax_k²)

where γ_k = 1/√(1 - v²/Vmax_k²)
```

### Energy-Momentum Relation

```
E_k² = (p·Vmax_k)² + (m·Vmax_k²)²
```

Special case for I_EM (Vmax = c):

```
E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²
```

## Philosophical Implications

### Ontology

- **Multiple layers of reality**: Each information space represents a different layer
- **Information is fundamental**: Spaces are defined by how information propagates
- **Emergence**: Our familiar space-time may emerge from I_0

### Epistemology

> "The limits of our measurements may not be the limits of reality"

We are confined to I_EM measurements, but reality may extend beyond.
